[My fans asked me to document](https://twitter.com/Kake/status/681896477514416129) how I cooked the anchovy aubergines that were part of the above dinner.

* Fry a sliced onion in the oil from a tin of anchovies in a medium-sized saucepan
* Slice an aubergine into 1 centimetre batons and fry with onions for a copule of  minutes
* Add the tin of anchovies
* Add a large teaspoon of red pepper paste and a large squeeze of garlic paste
* Fry for about 5 minutes
* Realise that the aubergine is reducing quite a bit
* Slice an aubergine into 1 centimetre batons and add to saucepan
* Fry for about 5 minutes
* Add some [Maggi Cube](http://amzn.to/1O3rivV) flavoured potato water.
* Cook for about another 10 minutes or until the aubergine is cooked to your liking
