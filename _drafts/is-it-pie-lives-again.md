title: is it pie lives again
---

About a year ago my co-located server died and to be honest it was a diseased
pet so good riddance.  One of the side effects of this was that several of the
websites I maintain died at the same time.  While I got the most important ones
back quite quickly on a variety of "cloud" servers some I didnt worry about.
One of these was [isitpie.com](http://isitpie.com) which it would seem at least
3 other people cared about. So I spent some time resurrecting it on Saturday.

First of all I created the correct directories on my
[Symbiosis](http://symbiosis.bytemark.co.uk/) install. Symbiosis is great way
to host multiple domains that you need web and email for. If you run it on
[bytemark's cloud](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/cloud/) you get free dns as well
which it will set up for you.  Then I created a [basic jekyll
site](https://github.com/rjw1/isitpie.com) and grabbed the most important
content from the [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150212203718/http://blog.isitpie.com/Rules_of_Pie.html)
and added it back. Then I told my [registrar](https://www.gandi.net) to change
my whois records to point at the bytemark DNS servers.

This all took me about 2 hours and now [isitpie.com](http://isitpie.com) lives
again. As an added bonus its also available on IPv6 now.
